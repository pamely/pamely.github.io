Birth Asphyxia (BA) is a major contributor to under-five mortality globally, causing over 2 million deaths yearly, with high prevalence in countries like Rwanda, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Survivors, around one million, often face neurocognitive challenges. Utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), particularly through newborn cry analysis (e.g., Ubenwa), offers a potential solution for early BA detection, while the proposed HumekaFL integrates ML and Federated Learning to prioritize privacy and security in health data analysis.
