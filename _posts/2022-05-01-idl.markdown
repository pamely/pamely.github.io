This is the final report of the course [11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning](https://duckduckgo.com](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F22/index.html) given by Prof Bhiksha Raj. In this report we explored how deep learning methods can help diagnosed effectively birth asphyxia. We implemented CNN, Bi-LSTM and an attention based pipelines to perform experiments.
