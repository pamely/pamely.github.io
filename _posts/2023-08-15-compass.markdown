The achievement of sustainable development goals requires collaboration among all stakeholders. In turn, this necessitates that the environment in which solutions are developed be inclusive of all. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely recognized to be a powerful enabling technology that can be used to leverage these solutions. However, AI, including the increasingly important field of robotics, is not inherently inclusive and much remains to be done in the democratization of AI. In this poster, we argue that inclusivity cannot be achieved without cultural sensitivity being factored into the design of AI and robotics technologies.
